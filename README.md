# Sabertooth 

***

Sabertooth was founded out of a desire to use Web 3's potential to develop solutions that strengthen communities. We have created and introduced three ground-breaking projects since our founding: Kawak, Gamebloc, and Bugbounty. From safe cryptocurrency transactions to community-driven gaming competitions and blockchain-based security improvements, each one exemplifies our dedication to peer-to-peer innovation and crowd-focused design. Our goal is to set the standard for a future that is more decentralized and connected.
